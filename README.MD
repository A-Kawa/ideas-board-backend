This is simple API for ideas-board, to start you need to add file "mongoDBpass.js" in main diractory.
This file must contain:

export const login = 'login';
export const password = 'password';

for the mLab account, also you need to add your own link to mlab at 10 line in server.js located in main directory.

When you did that just type in terminal "npm i" and then "npm start"
